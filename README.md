# tuxevil-rotator

**Production-ready OpenAI-compatible gateway for multiple free-tier LLM providers.**

> **Container migration notice:** `ghcr.io/tuxevil/pi-antigravity-rotator` is deprecated. Use [`ghcr.io/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator:latest`](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pkgs/container/tuxevil-rotator) for new deployments. The legacy image remains available as a frozen compatibility reference; see the [migration guide](docs/migrating-from-pi-antigravity-rotator.md).

Multi-account load balancing, per-model quota routing, account health scoring, access control with Virtual Keys, and cost auditing — via a single local endpoint that any agent can use. Even with a single account.

Originally built as a multi-account rotator for Google Antigravity. It now generalizes that rotation layer across free-tier LLM providers with per-account credentials: Google Antigravity, Ollama Cloud, OpenAI Codex, and OpenCode Zen, designed so new providers slot in without modifying core engine logic.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Using this proxy may put connected accounts at risk of Terms of Service enforcement, including restriction, suspension, or permanent bans. Use at your own risk.

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Terms of Service Warning — Read Before Installing</strong></summary>

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an unofficial tool. Routing traffic through this proxy may violate a provider's Terms of Service or trigger automated abuse or policy enforcement systems.
>
> **By using this proxy, you acknowledge:**
> - Your account may be restricted, suspended, shadow-banned, or permanently banned
> - Multi-account rotation and proxying can increase account risk compared to normal interactive usage
> - You assume all responsibility for the accounts and traffic routed through this tool
>
> **Recommendation:** Do not use your primary account on any provider. Prefer disposable or lower-risk accounts, and keep account exposure conservative.

</details>

> **Migrating from `pi-antigravity-rotator`?** Install the new `tuxevil-rotator` package. It includes the new CLI plus a legacy shim, automatically migrates legacy config files, and keeps old environment variables and paths working as fallbacks. See [Migration from pi-antigravity-rotator](docs/migrating-from-pi-antigravity-rotator.md).

---

## Current Model Update

- **Gemini 3.8 Flash Support**: Native Antigravity model IDs `gemini-3.8-flash-high`, `gemini-3.8-flash-medium`, and `gemini-3.8-flash-low`, with 1M-token context, 65,536-token output, pricing, quota routing, dashboard visualization, and telemetry support. Gemini 3.5 Flash has been removed from the user-facing catalog to match Antigravity 2.11. ([PR #28](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/28) by [@CyR1en](https://github.com/CyR1en))
- **Dynamic Antigravity Discovery**: Successful quota polls reconcile live model IDs and metadata per full account identity. Newly advertised models appear in `/v1/models` and route only to accounts that advertised them; removed models disappear without falling back to the generic Gemini pool. Legacy `gemini-3.5-*` IDs stay hidden, and configured `modelSpecs` substring overrides retain precedence. ([PR #29](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/29) by [@javargasm](https://github.com/javargasm))
- **Dynamic Catalog Hardening**: Quota snapshots reject malformed data while preserving the last known-good state, stale account responses are ignored, and dynamic model ownership and quota-safety state survive restarts without routing a model through an account that did not advertise it. ([PR #30](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/30) by [@javargasm](https://github.com/javargasm))
- **Partial Model Specification Overrides**: `modelSpecs` entries can override selected output, thinking, and context fields while inheriting the remaining effective runtime, static, or family metadata. Overrides are preserved through configuration normalization and persistence. ([PR #31](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/31) by [@javargasm](https://github.com/javargasm))
- **Effort-Based Model Routing**: Optional `effortRouting` aliases dispatch requests to concrete model variants from `reasoning_effort`, while preserving the alias for clients and tracking quotas against the resolved target. See [Effort-Based Model Routing](docs/configuration.md#effort-based-model-routing). ([PR #32](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/32) by [@CyR1en](https://github.com/CyR1en))
- **OpenAI-Compatible Audio Transcription and Live Streaming**: Added batch transcription and bidirectional WebSocket audio streaming through the local Antigravity observer model, with model aliases, transcript telemetry, CORS/preflight support, low-latency headers, and lifecycle/security coverage. ([PR #33](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/pull/33) by [@javargasm](https://github.com/javargasm))
- **Partial Quota Snapshot Recovery**: Reset-only Google quota entries are treated as exhausted instead of being discarded, and omitted pools remain available from the last known-good snapshot.
- **Independent Pool Cooldowns**: Shared Claude and Gemini pools reconcile cooldowns independently, so one exhausted pool does not block its sibling and fresh provider reset deadlines are honored. ([v3.6.1](https://github.com/tuxevil/tuxevil-rotator/releases/tag/v3.6.1))

## v3.2 Highlights

- **Gemini 3.7 Flash Support**: Full support for Google's Gemini 3.7 Flash models (`gemini-3.7-flash`, `gemini-3.7-flash-tiered`, `gemini-3.7-flash-high`, `gemini-3.7-flash-medium`, `gemini-3.7-flash-low`) with reasoning effort / thinking level translation, pricing, dashboard visualization, and telemetry.
- **OpenCode Zen Provider**: Added `opencode-zen` provider support (`deepseek-v4-flash-free`, `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-free`, `mimo-v2.5-free`, `hy3-free`) with static API key validation, onboarding UI tabs in `/login` and `/login-cli`, real-time quota tracking, and market-based cost savings estimates.
- **Streaming Tool Call Reliability**: Stateful preservation of tool call names and IDs across fragmented SSE chunks in multi-turn tool calling sessions.
- **Standardized Rate-Limit Retries**: Error responses for 429 now provide `retryAfterMs` and `retry_after_seconds` headers and payload data for fine-grained cooldown handling.
- **Provider Precedence Order**: Standardized provider order across quota pools, credentials, and UI displays (`google-antigravity` -> `ollama` -> `opencode-zen` -> `openai-codex`).

## v3.0 Highlights

- **Parent-Account Credential Model**: Each account (email) is now the parent entity and may hold per-provider credentials — a single human with both a Google Antigravity OAuth token and an Ollama Cloud API key lives in one account row. Login (`login --provider <id>`) and the legacy importer merge credentials onto existing accounts instead of duplicating by email.
- **Antigravity quota pools consolidated by family**: One quota bucket per family — `claude` (every Claude variant + gpt-oss) and `gemini` (every Gemini variant) — instead of one per model. The Antigravity quota API reports the same bucket for all of them, and the dashboard's consolidated RAW POLL line now shows both providers at once, with Antigravity pools first and Ollama last.
- **Ollama model pricing in `MODEL_PRICING`**: Spend summaries now report real USD for Ollama traffic (18 entries ported from the predecessor project's catalog of paid prices). Unknown models still return 0.
- **Routing robustness**: Dispatch for Ollama models now keys on the live catalog (`rotator.getOllamaModels()`), so models without `:` in the name (`minimax-m3`, `kimi-k3`, `glm-5.1`, `nemotron-3-super`, `deepseek-v4-pro`) no longer leak to the Antigravity adapter. Multi-turn tool-call requests now parse `function.arguments` to a real object before forwarding, since Ollama's Go API rejects OpenAI-style JSON-encoded strings.

## v2.7 Highlights

- **Multi-Provider Support**: The rotator routes through Google Antigravity, Ollama Cloud, and an isolated OpenAI Codex OAuth pool, with per-provider model catalog resolution and no automatic cross-provider fallback.
- **Provider Compatibility**: Ollama models use native `api/chat` NDJSON, while Codex models use native Responses HTTP/SSE with explicit Chat Completions conversion. `GET /v1/models` marks provider ownership for both catalogs.
- **Legacy Account Migration**: On startup, Ollama Cloud accounts from `~/.ollama-rotator/accounts.json` (the predecessor product, overridable via `OLLAMA_ROTATOR_DIR`) are imported automatically and merged onto the matching email — `provider: "ollama"`, preserving `label`/`tier`/`type`. Re-import is idempotent.
- **Flat-shape compatibility**: Existing configs with the legacy flat field layout (`apiKey`/`refreshToken` at the top level) are still accepted and normalized on load to the parent-account credential model.

## v2.6 Highlights

- **Lossless Prompt Compression**: Optional Lite and RTK compression modes preserve code-critical content while reducing prompt size. Enable `compressionMode` in `accounts.json` or override a request with `X-Rotator-Compression: lite`, `rtk`, or `rtk+lite`.
- **Operational Observability**: `X-Rotator-*` response headers expose routing, latency, token, cost, health, idempotency, and compression metrics without changing response bodies.
- **Reliable Request Handling**: Configurable pre-flush stream recovery, duplicate-request idempotency, asynchronous persistence, and an active-account benchmark improve production operations.
- **Dashboard Workspaces**: Refined Accounts, Virtual Keys, Spend Logs, telemetry, and notification experiences with responsive layouts, filtering, and consistent PII masking.
- **Security Hardening**: Refresh tokens now use salted `scrypt` plus AES-256-GCM for new encrypted records, legacy encrypted tokens remain readable, and public error responses no longer expose internal details.

## v2.5 Highlights

- **Automated GHCR Multi-arch Builds**: Official Docker images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry.
- **Pre-built Docker Deployment**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` to pull pre-built GHCR images directly out-of-the-box.

## v2.4 Highlights

- **Virtual Keys & Scoped Access Control**: Generate scoped API keys (`rk-...`) with per-key model authorization rules and user tracking.
- **Spend Logging & Audit Inspector**: PostgreSQL audit trail of all requests, token metrics, TTFB/Total duration, Base64 media sanitization, 6-decimal USD cost breakdown, and Request/Response payload viewer.
- **Multi-page Web Dashboard**: Unified header navigation connecting Accounts, Virtual Keys, and Spend Logs, featuring customizable column visibility, search/filtering, and instant PII masking.
- **PostgreSQL Persistence Backend**: Enable `TUXEVIL_ROTATOR_DATABASE_URL` for high-concurrency key validation, persistent spend logging, and retention policies.

---

### Compression and token encryption

Compression is disabled by default. To enable a default mode, add this field to `accounts.json`:

```json
{
  "compressionMode": "lite"
}
```

For a single request, send `X-Rotator-Compression: lite`, `rtk`, or `rtk+lite`. The response reports the selected mode and savings through `X-Rotator-Compression-*` headers.

To encrypt refresh tokens at rest, set a secret before starting the rotator. A 64-character hexadecimal key is recommended:

```bash
export TUXEVIL_ROTATOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
tuxevil-rotator start
```

Existing `enc:v1` records remain decryptable during migration; newly written records use `enc:v2`.

> **Legacy env vars still work:** `PI_ROTATOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is honored as a fallback so existing setups keep working without changes.

---

## Features

- **Multi-provider gateway** — OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages`) plus native Ollama (`/api/chat`) routes; any agent or tool can use either
- **Google Antigravity accounts** — OAuth load balancing across a pool, with per-model independent routing
- **Ollama Cloud accounts** — Static-API-key accounts (`login --provider ollama`) for the Ollama Cloud catalog (`gpt-oss`, `gemma4`, `kimi-k3`, `minimax-m3`, `qwen3.5`, `glm-5`, `mistral-large-3`, `nemotron-3`, `deepseek-v4`)
- **Parent-account credentials** — One email, many providers; the same human with Google OAuth and an Ollama key is one row in `accounts.json`, with `credentials: [{provider, apiKey|refreshToken, projectId}]` instead of duplicate rows by email
- **Provider-agnostic rotation** — The rotation engine treats Antigravity and Ollama uniformly. The next free-tier provider with a per-account credential and a quota API slots in as a new `--provider` value without forking the engine.
- **Multi-account load balancing** — Distributes traffic across a pool of accounts with per-model independent routing
- **One-command account setup** — `tuxevil-rotator login` auto-discovers (or provisions) the Cloud Code companion project for brand-new Google accounts; `login --provider ollama` adds an Ollama Cloud API key to an existing email or creates a new one
- **Smart rotation & health scoring** — Six routing policies (`timer-first`, `tier-first`, `quota-first`, `hybrid`, `sequential-quota`, `sticky-quota`) with composite health scores per account
- **Real-time quota monitoring** — Polls each provider's quota API on its own cadence; Antigravity quota pools are consolidated by family (`claude`, `gemini`) and Ollama reports session/weekly usage
- **Infringement & abuse detection** — Flags accounts on enforcement signals and triggers protective pause to preserve the rest of the pool
- **Virtual Keys & access control** — Issue scoped `rk-...` keys for teams, agents, or CI pipelines with per-key model restrictions
- **Spend logging & audit inspector** — Full request/response audit trail with 6-decimal USD cost estimates for both Antigravity and Ollama traffic (requires PostgreSQL)
- **Legacy importer** — On startup, automatically merges Ollama Cloud accounts from `~/.ollama-rotator/accounts.json` (the predecessor product) onto existing accounts, idempotently
- **Web dashboard** — Real-time routing state, quota bars, latency tracking (p50/p95), savings chart, activity heatmap, and routing inspector
- **State persistence** — Survives restarts; routing assignments, cooldowns, and flags saved to disk or PostgreSQL
- **Tool/function calling** — Fully supported in OpenAI and Anthropic formats, including multi-turn and parallel tool calls, with reliable function-name resolution for tool responses across turns. Ollama forwards `function.arguments` as a parsed object (OpenAI sends it as a JSON string and Ollama's Go API rejects that).
- **Reasoning/thinking visibility** — Interleaved thinking blocks exposed as `reasoning_content` / `thinking_delta` in real time

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+ for npm/source installs. Docker image uses Node 22.

### Option A: npm

```bash
npm install -g tuxevil-rotator
tuxevil-rotator login                  # Google Antigravity (default)
tuxevil-rotator login --provider ollama  # Ollama Cloud (static API key)
tuxevil-rotator login --provider openai-codex  # ChatGPT OAuth (isolated Codex pool)
tuxevil-rotator login --provider opencode-zen # OpenCode Zen (static API key)
tuxevil-rotator start
```

Ollama Cloud accounts from a previous `~/ollama-rotator` install are imported automatically at startup — no manual step required.

```

Each model routes to its own best available account independently. The same email can hold both a Google OAuth credential and an Ollama Cloud API key (parent-account model) — the rotator picks the right credential at request time based on the destination model.

How model routing works:
- **Antigravity pool** — Claude variants (`claude-opus-4-6-thinking`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-oss-120b`) share the `claude` quota bucket; Gemini variants share the `gemini` bucket.
- **Ollama pool** — Any model returned by `https://ollama.com/api/tags` (e.g. `gemma4:31b`, `gpt-oss:20b`, `minimax-m3`, `kimi-k3`) routes to an Ollama credential.
- The pool is selected by the destination model's provider; a single account with both credentials participates in both pools.

[How it works in detail →](docs/how-it-works.md)

## Dashboard

After starting the proxy, open `http://localhost:51200/dashboard`.

The dashboard shows:
- **Routing state** — real-time status, uptime, requests, protective pause timers
- **Account cards** — quota bars (Antigravity family buckets `claude` / `gemini`; Ollama session/weekly usage), per-model timers, health scores, flagged alerts
- **Token usage & savings** — interactive chart with time ranges and CSV/JSON export (real USD for both providers)
- **Latency (p50/p95)** — per-model TTFB and total duration
- **Activity heatmap** — 60-day GitHub-style request intensity grid
- **Quota forecast** — tier-weighted depletion predictions
- **Routing inspector** — on-demand modal with candidate scores, health-score breakdown, and rejection reasons

## Virtual Keys & Spend Logging

With PostgreSQL, the gateway adds enterprise-grade access control and cost auditing.

```bash
# Set up PostgreSQL (or paste the prompt in docs/integrations/setup-postgresql.md into your AI agent)
export TUXEVIL_ROTATOR_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:***@localhost:5432/rotatordb"

# Generate a scoped key
tuxevil-rotator keys generate --alias "cursor-agent" --models "gemini-3.6-flash-high"
# → rk-a1b2c3d4...
```

## Why its called "tuxevil-rotator" now?

This project started as a focused, single-purpose rotator for pi coder agent and for Google Antigravity provider. As the rotation engine matured and the Ollama Cloud integration landed, the same engine applied cleanly to any free-tier provider with per-account credentials and a quota API. Renaming to `tuxevil-rotator` makes that generalization explicit: the provider is a plug-in, the rotation is the product.

A few things shaped the decision concretely:

- The original name (`pi-antigravity-rotator`) signaled "I only know one provider." That's no longer true.
- The account store moved to a parent-account model where one email can hold credentials for multiple providers. The product surface needed to follow.
- Open-sourcing the rotator as `pi-*` implied it was only interesting inside the `pi.dev` ecosystem. The engine itself is provider-agnostic and useful in any agent stack.

The name comes from the maintainer's nickname (`tuxevil`). It's also the namespace already used across this maintainer's other open-source work, so the rotator stops being a one-off and becomes part of a recognizable family of tools.

> **Want the longer story?** A deeper post on the rationale, the design tradeoffs, and the provider-pluggable architecture is on the maintainer's blog: [Why I renamed pi-antigravity-rotator to tuxevil-rotator](https://tuxevil.com/en/blog/tuxevil-rotator/).
